# Process Text Files with Python Dictionaries and Upload to Running Web Service

Coursera's Automating Real-World Tasks with Python Week 2 assesment solved by me.

The "run.py" is my script for this activity.

Basically there's a folder on this server ("/data/feedback") which has .txt files with information for uploading to the server. I had to take them, process and post them into the server assigned which IP was "35.238.225.247".
